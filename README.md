Initially, you need to connect to Jupiter at work.
This can be done by direct connection to the robot using HDMI and USB cables.
Another connection option is to connect to the TP-Link_C1 C18/ TP-Link_C1 C18_5G/ shared network.
Network connection password: 65751329. Password to log in to the robot system: jetbot.
